Jos√©'s Modules
============

All modules in jose derive from the code in `example_module.py`.

**ADVICE FOR NEW MODULES**: Since `jaux.Auxiliar` is being used in the example code, it is gonna be used in all modules since it doesn't create circular imports(like jcommon importing jcoin that imports jcommon...)
