# JoséCoin

JoséCoins(Abbreviated as JC) are the currency of José, used usually for paying taxes to use other commands.
JC Wallets aren't created automatically, this is a design & performance choice. To create, use `j!account`.

## JoséCoin Generation

Each message you send(to a server where José is, obviously), has a 1% random chance of receiving a reward.
That reward can be 0.2, 0.6, 1, 1.2 or 1.5 JC. José reacts with :moneybag: when you receive a reward.
